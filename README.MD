Audiobook Toolbox
===============
This repo contains some simple scripts for helping to deal with m4b audiobooks. This is mostly for personal use, but it is possible others might find something of value here. Included are some script files I've found handy, as well as some ramblings to help me remember how things work. Most likely anyone finding this will be better served by the far more extensive [m4b-Tool](https://github.com/sandreas/m4b-tool).

> ðŸ›ˆ **Note:** m4b and m4a are the same format, with m4b being used for audiobooks by convention only. You can freely rename an m4a file to m4b and visa versa.

Requirements
-----
This tool box is just a fairly basic wrapper to for some other much more powerful tools that are required. All the scripts here can be used on Windows using the Linux Subsystem.
 * ffmpeg
 * mp4V2-Utils
 * gpac

The requirements call be installed as follows:
 ```
 sudo apt install ffmpeg mp4v2-utils gpac
 ```

Chapters
===============
Some shops, such as the Google Play Store, provide m4a/m4b files without chapters for their audiobooks. It is possible add the chapters in manually without re-encoding.

Locating the chapter points is manual process unfortunately. Audacity has a silence detector which can be a good starting point (I recommend searching for silence of 3 seconds for longer, and placing the label 0.3 seconds before the end of the silence). It is possible to export the labels generated as a tab separated text file which I have included tools for processing (it can also be easily fiddled with in excel or similar). Once timestamps for each chapter are located you can use them to generate a chapter file in the quicktime format.

```
00:00:00 Track 1 Title
00:10:00 Track 2 Title
```

Once you have your chapter file you can use `chapters` to import the chapters.

```
